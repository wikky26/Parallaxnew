    <h2>TOP TIPS FOR YOUR FIRST CYCLING RACE</h2>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character main">Y</span>our first cycle race will inevitably be a daunting experience, but as long as you’ve put the training in, accustomed yourself to group riding, and put all your pre-race and race plans into action it should be an experience you’ll want to repeat many times over. Here are a few tips to help you with your first bike race.</p>

      <h2>Be accustomed to group riding</h2>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character sc">I</span>n training be sure to get out in multiple group rides so you will be used to riding among other riders at high speeds and in tightly-packed groups. Chaingang training sessions with a local club will help you in this respect. Group riding with a club will have taught you about the benefits of drafting plus the cycling etiquette you’ll need to get around without incurring the wrath of other riders.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Always familiarise yourself with the course. Often race organisers will share a map of the route well in advance so you’ll have had a chance to check out the ride and perhaps ride sections, if not all of it beforehand. If it’s going to be hilly course, then be prepared to climb and have a rough idea of the length of the climbs so you don’t expend all your energy part way up a climb. Take note of all the potential hazards and danger points on the course so you are well prepared.</p>

    <h2>Check your bike over</h2>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character ny">A</span> day before the race give your bike a thorough checking over. Don’t leave anything untested. Make sure nothing is loose and check your shifting and that your brakes are functioning properly. Give your chain and drivetrain a good cleaning and lubricate, and also check your tyres over for any deep cuts or anything untoward.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">The night before your race pack everything you will need. Have a good idea of the expected weather so you can pack accordingly. Have a checklist including cycling top, bibshorts, socks, shoes, helmet, gloves, and items such as jacket/cape and overshoes if the weather is expected to be unfavourable. Some race also require you to have race license so don’t forget to pack that too.</p>

    <h2>Bottles and food</h2>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character atw">L</span>ikewise, make sure you have all your water bottles filled, and your energy bars and gels ready so you are not having to do this on the day of your race. The amount you need will depend on the length of your race. If you are racing for around an hour maximum then one bottle and gel will likely suffice. If you’re doing a longer event, then you need to try and eat and drink around 500 calories per hour after the first hour.  </p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">The night before a race is not the time to start experimenting with what you eat. Just eat the same kind of carbohydrate-rich meal that you would the evening before a training ride. If your regular meal is a mountain of pasta, then stick to that option. Also don’t forget to hydrate the evening before your race.</p>
